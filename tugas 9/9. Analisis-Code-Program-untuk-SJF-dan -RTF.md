## 1. SJF Without Arrival Time (Non-Preemptive)

In **SJF (Shortest Job First) without Arrival Time**, all processes are assumed to arrive simultaneously. The system processes the job with the smallest burst time first. Being **Non-Preemptive** means that once a process starts execution, it cannot be interrupted until completion.

### Code Structure Analysis

#### 1. Process Structure
```cpp
struct proc {
    int no, bt, ct, tat, wt;
};
```
Where:
- `no`: Process number
- `bt`: Burst time
- `ct`: Completion time
- `tat`: Turnaround time
- `wt`: Waiting time

#### 2. Input Function
The `read(int i)` function collects data for a process, setting its number and requesting burst time from the user.

#### 3. Sorting Mechanism
The algorithm reads all processes and then sorts them based on burst time using bubble sort:
```cpp
for(int i=0; i<n-1; i++)
    for(int j=0; j<n-i-1; j++)
        if(p[j].bt > p[j+1].bt)
            swap(p[j], p[j+1]);
```

#### 4. Time Calculations
The algorithm calculates key metrics for each process:
```cpp
for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
    ct += p[i].bt;       // Total time until process i completes
    p[i].ct = ct;
    p[i].tat = ct;       // TAT = CT (since arrival time is 0)
    p[i].wt = p[i].tat - p[i].bt;
    avgwt += p[i].wt;
    avgtat += p[i].tat;
}
```

### Example Execution

For input processes:
- P1: Burst Time = 6
- P2: Burst Time = 8
- P3: Burst Time = 7
- P4: Burst Time = 3

After sorting by burst time: P4 (3), P1 (6), P3 (7), P2 (8)

**Gantt Chart:**
```
| P4 | P1 | P3 | P2 |
0    3    9    16   24
```

**Output:**
```
ProcessNo       BT      CT      TAT     WT      RT
P4              3       3       3       0       0
P1              6       9       9       3       3
P3              7       16      16      9       9
P2              8       24      24      16      16

Average TurnAroundTime=13.000000
Average WaitingTime=7.000000
```

### Advantages and Disadvantages

**Advantages:**
- Reduces average waiting time compared to FCFS
- Well-suited for small, short processes

**Disadvantages:**
- Doesn't consider arrival time
- May cause starvation for processes with larger burst times

## 2. SJF With Arrival Time (Non-Preemptive)

In **SJF with Arrival Time**, processes arrive at different times. The scheduler selects the process with the shortest burst time among those that have arrived. Being **Non-Preemptive** means that once a process starts, it runs to completion.

### Code Structure Analysis

#### 1. Process Structure
```cpp
struct proc {
    int no, at, bt, it, ct, tat, wt;
};
```
Where:
- `no`: Process number
- `at`: Arrival time
- `bt`: Burst time
- `it`: Initial execution time
- `ct`: Completion time
- `tat`: Turnaround time
- `wt`: Waiting time

#### 2. Arrival Time Sorting
First, processes are sorted based on arrival time:
```cpp
for (int i=0; i<n-1; i++)
    for (j=0; j<n-i-1; j++)
        if (p[j].at > p[j+1].at)
            swap(p[j], p[j+1]);
```

#### 3. Initial Process Selection
If multiple processes arrive simultaneously at the beginning, the one with the smallest burst time is selected:
```cpp
for(j=1; j<n && p[j].at == p[0].at; j++)
    if(p[j].bt < p[min].bt)
        min = j;
```

#### 4. Scheduling Logic
For each slot after the first process completes:
- Find all processes that have arrived by the completion time of the previous process
- Among these, select the one with the smallest burst time
- If no process has arrived, the CPU remains idle until the next arrival

```cpp
// First process
p[0].it = p[0].at;
p[0].ct = p[0].it + p[0].bt;

// Remaining processes
for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    // Find process with smallest burst time that has already arrived
    for (j = i+1, min = i; j < n && p[j].at <= p[i-1].ct; j++)
        if (p[j].bt < p[min].bt)
            min = j;

    swap(p[i], p[min]);

    if (p[i].at <= p[i-1].ct)
        p[i].it = p[i-1].ct;
    else
        p[i].it = p[i].at;

    p[i].ct = p[i].it + p[i].bt;
}
```

#### 5. Metric Calculations
```cpp
p[i].tat = p[i].ct - p[i].at;
p[i].wt = p[i].tat - p[i].bt;
```

### Example Execution

For input processes:
- P1: Arrival Time = 0, Burst Time = 8
- P2: Arrival Time = 1, Burst Time = 4
- P3: Arrival Time = 2, Burst Time = 9
- P4: Arrival Time = 3, Burst Time = 5

**Execution Sequence:**
1. P1 arrives first → executes (BT = 8) → completes at t = 8
2. At t = 8, P2, P3, P4 have all arrived; P2 has smallest BT (4)
3. Next P4 (BT = 5), then P3 (BT = 9)

**Gantt Chart:**
```
| P1 | P2 | P4 | P3 |
0    8    12   17   26
```

**Output:**
```
Process         AT      BT      CT      TAT     WT      RT
P1              0       8       8       8       0       0
P2              1       4       12      11      7       7
P4              3       5       17      14      9       9
P3              2       9       26      24      15      15

Average TurnAroundTime=14.250000
Average WaitingTime=7.750000
```

### Advantages and Disadvantages

**Advantages:**
- More realistic by considering arrival times
- Reduces average waiting time when shorter processes arrive early

**Disadvantages:**
- Risk of starvation for processes with large burst times
- Less optimal when arrival times are random and critical processes need priority

## 3. SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First) Scheduling Algorithm (Preemptive)

In **SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First)**, the CPU checks all arrived processes at each time unit and selects the one with the shortest remaining execution time. If a new process arrives with a shorter burst time than the remaining time of the currently running process, the current process is preempted (temporarily suspended).

### Code Structure Analysis

#### 1. Process Structure
```cpp
struct proc {
    int no, at, bt, rt, ct, tat, wt;
};
```
Where:
- `no`: Process number
- `at`: Arrival time
- `bt`: Burst time
- `rt`: Remaining time
- `ct`: Completion time
- `tat`: Turnaround time
- `wt`: Waiting time

#### 2. Initialization
The `read(int i)` function collects data and initializes remaining time equal to burst time.

#### 3. Time-based Simulation
The algorithm simulates execution at each time unit:
```cpp
p[9].rt = MAX;  // Sentinel value
for(time=0; remain != n; time++) {
    s = 9;
    for (i=0; i<n; i++) {
        if (p[i].at <= time && p[i].rt < p[s].rt && p[i].rt > 0)
            s = i;
    }
    p[s].rt--;
    
    if(p[s].rt == 0) {
        remain++;
        p[s].ct = time + 1;
        // Calculate metrics
    }
}
```

This approach:
- Checks all processes that have arrived at the current time
- Selects the one with the smallest remaining time
- Decrements its remaining time by 1
- Records completion when remaining time reaches zero

### Example Execution

For input processes:
- P1: Arrival Time = 0, Burst Time = 8
- P2: Arrival Time = 1, Burst Time = 4
- P3: Arrival Time = 2, Burst Time = 9
- P4: Arrival Time = 3, Burst Time = 5

**Execution Sequence:**
1. t = 0: P1 starts (only process available)
2. t = 1: P2 arrives (BT = 4 < P1's remaining time) → P2 preempts P1
3. t = 5: P2 completes
4. t = 5: P4 (BT = 5) competes with P1 (remaining = 7) → P4 executes
5. t = 10: P4 completes
6. t = 10: P1 (remaining = 7) and P3 (BT = 9) compete → P1 resumes
7. And so on...

**Gantt Chart:**
```
|P1|P2|P2|P2|P2|P4|P4|P4|P4|P4|P1|P1|P1|P1|P1|P1|P1|P3|P3|P3|P3|P3|P3|P3|P3|P3|
0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26
```

**Output:**
```
Process         AT      BT      CT      TAT     WT
P2              1       4       5       4       0
P4              3       5       10      7       2
P1              0       8       17      17      9
P3              2       9       26      24      15

Average TurnAroundTime=13.000000
Average WaitingTime=6.500000
```

### Advantages and Disadvantages

**Advantages:**
- More responsive to short processes that arrive during execution
- Optimizes average waiting time

**Disadvantages:**
- More complex to implement
- Can cause starvation for processes with larger burst times
